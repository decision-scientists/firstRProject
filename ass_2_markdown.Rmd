## Wave Plot

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
x <- seq(0,20,0.01)
y <- sin(x)
sin_df <- data.frame(x,y)
plot(x,y)
```

## Replicability and reproducibility

Replicability : Performing the experiment again and collecting new data.

Reproducibility : Performing the experiment with same code but with a different analyst.

Replicability is stronger.When we perform the experiment on new data and arrive at the same conclusions, this helps us make decisions with higher confidence.
